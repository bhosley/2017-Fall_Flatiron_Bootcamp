# 2017-Fall_Flatiron_Bootcamp
 Bootcamp files separate from regular schoolwork

Because the Flatiron program insisted in publishing an obscene number of repos, 
I have gone through the effort of gathering them here.
Normally would have included these files in (schoolwork)[https://github.com/bhosley/Schoolwork]
but they took up way too much space, were not worth pulling local, and messed with the language stats.
